#Value Proposition:
One-click “Strategy Pack”: clustered themes → HMWs → prioritized opportunities → OKRs → roadmap

# MVP Scope
## Must-haves
1. **App shell (dark mode) with left nav: Home, Documents, Exports, Settings** 
2. **Top bar: Paste notes area + "Generate Strategy" primary button** 
3. **Cards row: Themes, HMWs, Opportunities, OKRs, Roadmap** 
4. **Energy‑style chart section → "Opportunity Map" (bar or scatter by theme weight)** 
5. **Evidence drawer per theme (expand to view quotes)** 
6. **Right rail: Export panel (Markdown, CSV), Download links, Session stats** 
7. **Footer: Model + version + latency; Privacy note**

## Objective 1: Ship a public MVP that converts notes into a strategy pack in less than 60s.
KR1: Deployed app accessible on Streamlit Cloud with README. 
KR2: Process 3+ real transcripts/notes end-to-end without errors. 
KR3: Achieve TTS less than 60s on a 2,500‑word input. 

## Objective 2: Demonstrate accuracy and usefulness.
KR4: Precision in Top 5 themes greater than 0.7 on pilot rubric (n=5 docs). 
KR5: greater than 80% of pilot users rate actionability above 4/5.
